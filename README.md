This is Online Wars, a project that is responsible for my career in programming and web development.
It is a web page based MMO RPG game, situated in times of World Wars ( early 20th century).

I upload this only because this is the first web code I have ever written.
Code is messy, and in general its against any good coder's practise or any reasonable code regime.
Repeating Views, mixing business logic with views, not having any structure, and having everything in one file. I know, I know.. could point them for ages.

Requirements: PHP5, mySQL and LOTS of patience.

Installation: 
	
	1. Clone repo

	2. Create & import mySQL database using schema.sql file

	3. Edit functions.php and replace your mySQL credentials on line 9

	4. Run the index page of the browser

	5. Login using user: admin password: test123

	6. Enjoy! (If the code holds tight and doesnt throw any error messages)
